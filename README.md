Summary
In the above reference, two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples. The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

Features
1 - fixed acidity 

2 - volatile acidity 

3 - citric acid 

4 - residual sugar 

5 - chlorides 

6 - free sulfur dioxide 

7 - total sulfur dioxide 

8 - density 

9 - pH 

10 - sulphates 

11 - alcohol 

Target variable

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
